DVRPC's Community Investment Index maps the concentrations of recent (2000 through 2010) place-based investments that contribute to sustainable communities, as well as supportive planning activities and underlying development characteristics. Taken together, these maps summarize a location's ability to leverage new sustainability- or livability-oriented investments.

The purpose of these maps is to help planning partners and project sponsors understand how new project proposals can support-and be supported by-prior investments across a range of disciplines (or "topic areas"). For example, a proposal for a new transit facility or trail connection could be strengthened if it builds upon a recent investment in affordable housing or a brownfield redevelopment proposal.
