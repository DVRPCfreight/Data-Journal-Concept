The Data Navigator allows visitors to find various datasets for a given municipality or county. It automatically provides a map of the geography being queried and a graph of the data. To date, you can view Census information, crash data, population and employment forecasts, and more.  New datasets will be added to this interface as they become available, so check back often. To view the application, visit [http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/DataNavigator/default.aspx](http://www.dvrpc.org/asp/DataNavigator/default.aspx).
