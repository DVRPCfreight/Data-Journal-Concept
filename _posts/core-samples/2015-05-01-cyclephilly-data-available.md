The launch of the CyclePhilly smartphone app has provided a valuable glimpse into the bicycling habits of Greater Philadelphia. Since it the app was launched, 220 bicyclists used CyclePhilly to record their routes, and the resulting data is now available for sharing and use. The data received provides an additional resource for local planners and agencies in an effort to understand bicycle trends, routes, and trip purposes, implement better bicycle facilities, and connect the region’s trail network, known as The Circuit.

Three additional datasets have been added to the “download data” tab under “Tools and Data” on the [DVRPC web site](http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/CyclePhilly/).
