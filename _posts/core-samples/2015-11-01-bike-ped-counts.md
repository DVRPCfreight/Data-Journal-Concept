DVRPC collects traffic volume counts at over 5,000 locations each year, including vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Vehicle and bicycle count data is collected by the pneumatic tubes you see laying across the road, and pedestrian counts utilize heat sensors that count passing people. In addition, there are 12 permanent bicycle and pedestrian counters on trails throughout the region. This traffic data is used by transportation engineers and planners, developers, and market analysts to make informed decisions in their work.
